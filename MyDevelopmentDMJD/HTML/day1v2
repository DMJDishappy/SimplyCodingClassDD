    <p>Flaming flamingos cannot be differentiated from a normal flamingo until they set themselves on fire. 
      The fire does no damage to the flamingo nor other flaming flamingos. 
      Surprisingly, normal flamingos are also immune to the flames. 
      <b>Humans are not immune.</b> 
      Treat flamingos with an abundance of caution and keep your children from approaching them.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <h2>WARNING! USE CAUTION!</h2>
      <h2><STRONG>Flamingos are especially attracted to shrimp, 
        which makes it <em>extremely dangerous</em> to have on your person.</STRONG>
