    <p>Flaming flamingos cannot be differentiated from a normal flamingo until they set themselves on fire. 
      The fire does no damage to the flamingo nor other flaming flamingos. 
      Surprisingly, normal flamingos are also immune to the flames. 
      <b>Humans are not immune.</b> 
      Treat flamingos with an abundance of caution and keep your children from approaching them.</p>
